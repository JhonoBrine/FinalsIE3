The Groceries Dataset consists of transaction data collected from a supermarket. 
Each transaction represents the items purchased by a customer during a shopping trip.

### Key Fields:
- **Member_number**: A unique identifier for a customer.
- **itemDescription**: The name of the purchased item.
- **Date**: The date of purchase.

Below is a sample of the dataset:

# Section 2: What is the Apriori Algorithm?
st.header("üîç What is the Apriori Algorithm?")
st.write("""
The **Apriori Algorithm** is a popular data mining technique for identifying frequent itemsets in transactional datasets. 
It is widely applied in market basket analysis to uncover item combinations that frequently occur together.

### How it Works:
1. **Frequent Itemsets**: Identifies itemsets meeting a minimum support threshold.
2. **Association Rules**: Derives rules that indicate relationships between items.

### Key Metrics:
- **Support**: Proportion of transactions containing a specific item or itemset.
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of an item being purchased when another is purchased.
- **Lift**: Strength of an association rule compared to random chance.

For example:
If "bread" and "butter" appear together in 30% of transactions, and "bread" appears in 40%, 
then the confidence of the rule "bread ‚Üí butter" is 75%.

Below is a simplified example of frequent itemsets:

# Example of frequent itemsets table
example_data = {
    "Itemset": ["Bread, Butter", "Milk, Cookies", "Tea, Sugar"],
    "Support": [0.3, 0.25, 0.4],
}
example_df = pd.DataFrame(example_data)
st.table(example_df)
